#1251. Average Selling Price

#NOTE 1: I was shocked that BETWEEN AND could be some SQL keywords....

#1633. Percentage of Users Attended a Contest

#NOTE 1: Got to know how ORDER BY functions and structures.
#NOTE 2: GROUP BY processes earlier than SELECT. From → Where → Group By → Having → Select → Order By → Limit
#NOTE 3: Subquery is interesing, which also needs a SELECT to complete.
