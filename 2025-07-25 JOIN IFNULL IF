#570. Managers with at Least 5 Direct Reports

#NOTE 1: We can use JOIN function to JOIN a table that we created.

SELECT e1.name
FROM Employee e1
JOIN(
    SELECT managerId
    FROM Employee
    WHERE managerId IS NOT NULL
    GROUP BY managerId

    ) e2

#1934. Confirmation Rate

#NOTE 1: IFNULL(,0) is a good way to transfer NULL to 0.
#NOTE 2: SUM(c.action = 'confirmed') will return 1,0,NULL. (And the NULLs need to be coped with IFNULL)
#NOTE 3: "ROUND(AVG(IF((c.action = 'confirmed'),1,0)),2) AS confirmation_rate" also works. IF statement is interesting. 

SELECT s.user_id, 
    IFNULL(
        ROUND(
            SUM(c.action = 'confirmed') / COUNT(c.action),
            2),
        0)
    AS confirmation_rate

    ON s.user_id = c.user_id
